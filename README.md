# Finding Nemo 
An Android application to detect the geographical locations of other users and to demonstrate them on a satellite map.
## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application during our Grade 11 as High school students in VNU-HCM High School for the Gifted.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Hadn't it been for the support from Google, StackOverFlow, Youtube, and Flutter community, we wouldn't have been able to conduct our first-time application project.
